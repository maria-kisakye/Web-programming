    "7. Foundational Tree Concepts (10 Marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree**: A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node called the root, and zero or more subtrees.\n",
    "- **Root**: The topmost node of a tree. It has no parent.\n",
    "- **Parent**: A node that has one or more child nodes.\n",
    "- **Child**: A node that is a descendant of another node (its parent).\n",
    "- **Leaf**: A node that has no children.\n",
    "- **Sibling**: Nodes that share the same parent.\n",
    "- **Ancestor**: A node that is connected to another node by a path of edges going upwards.\n",
    "- **Descendant**: A node that is connected to another node by a path of edges going downwards.\n",
    "- **Subtree**: A tree consisting of a node and all its descendants.\n",
    "- **Height**: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.\n",
    "- **Depth**: The length of the path from the root to a given node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linked Lists**:\n",
    "   - Each node contains data and references (pointers) to its children.\n",
    "   - Commonly used for binary trees where each node has at most two children (left and right).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class TreeNode:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "           self.value = value\n",
    "           self.left = None\n",
    "           self.right = None\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Arrays**:\n",
    "   - Trees can be represented using arrays, especially binary heaps.\n",
    "   - For a binary tree, the root is at index 0. For a node at index `i`, its left child is at `2*i + 1` and its right child is at `2*i + 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   tree = [None] * 10  # Example array representation of a tree\n",
    "   tree[0] = 'A'  # Root\n",
    "   tree[1] = 'B'  # Left child of root\n",

    "   print(\"Inorder Traversal:\")\n",
    "   inorder_traversal(root)  # Output: D B E A C\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preorder Traversal** (Root, Left, Right):\n",
    "   - Visit the root node, the left subtree, and then the right subtree.\n",
    "   - Used to create a copy of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   preorder_traversal(root)  # Output: A B D E C\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Postorder Traversal** (Left, Right, Root):\n",
    "   - Visit the left subtree, the right subtree, and then the root node.\n",
    "   - Used to delete the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def postorder_traversal(root):\n",
    "       if root:\n",
    "           postorder_traversal(root.left)\n",

    "   - Uses a queue to keep track of nodes at the current level.\n",
